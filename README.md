# HollowKnight.InfoPanelUtil

Debug addon that adds more options for creating info panels.

This mod requires Debug Mod, but all the panels defined here can be referenced safely
without DebugMod installed through MonoMod ModInterop, and will only be displayable if
both this and DebugMod are installed.
